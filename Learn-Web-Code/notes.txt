-> Cookies are sent by server (just req once)
-> Then that cookie will be stored in user's browser
-> Now Each request from that browser to website will contain that cookie in header
-> HTTP cookies generally follow the same-origin policy.
   The same-origin policy is a security mechanism enforced by web browsers
   that restricts how documents or scripts loaded from one origin (domain, protocol, and port)
   can interact with resources from a different origin.
   
   When a web server sends a cookie to a browser,
   the cookie is associated with a specific domain and, optionally, a path.
   When subsequent requests are made to the same domain and path,
   the browser includes the relevant cookies in the request headers.
   This allows the server to identify and track the user session.

-> You can checkout the documentation of your server-side language or framework and can find the options passed for Cookies

*************CSRF attack
-> Cookies will be automatically sent to domain from user behalf, so someone can use that url and trick you through clickbait by having hidden from
   and using same cookie

-> You can assume it, normally you were doing it directly communicating with website, but someone else did this from your behalf
   through clickbaits


*************Practical Usage of Cookies (session)
-> By looking into benefits/behavior of cookies that they are sent with each request
-> We can manage user sessions, we can remember about user, what will we do, we will store user values in DB and will client will be authorizes through an id which will be passed in cookies
-> If id matches server will recognize user and will give appropriate recommendations etc, because server will extract data from DB depending on that id

*************How to Trust Users (JWT)
